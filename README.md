# Chat_Challenge

Challenge description:
You are a software developer and have been given the task of implementing a real-time chat system using MongoDB and Mongoose. Your goal is to create an application that allows users to communicate with each other in real time, without the need for authentication or session management.
Steps to follow:
- MongoDB configuration:
Create a cloud MongoDB cluster (for example, MongoDB Atlas) and set up a database for the project.
It uses Mongoose to define a data model for chat messages, including fields like content, sender, recipient, date, etc.
- Sending and receiving messages:
Implement API endpoints to send and receive chat messages.
Allows users to submit messages through a form or user interface in real time.
It stores the messages in the database and shows the most recent messages in the chat interface.
- WebSocket integration:
Set up a WebSocket server using a library like Socket.IO.
Establishes a WebSocket connection between the server and the client to enable real-time communication.
Implements the logic for sending and receiving messages over the WebSocket connection.
- Real time update:
Updates the chat interface in real time to show new messages without having to refresh the page.
It uses WebSocket events to notify clients when a new message is sent.

Testing and documentation:
Carry out tests to verify the correct operation of the chat in real time.
Documents the API endpoints and chat system implementation details.
The challenge focuses on building a real-time chat system using MongoDB and Mongoose. Authentication and session handling are not required for this challenge. The proper implementation of the functionality for sending and receiving messages will be valued, as well as the real-time update of the chat interface. In addition, clear documentation and testing is expected to ensure the proper functioning of the system. Good luck developing this challenge!
